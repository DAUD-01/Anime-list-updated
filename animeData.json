Yet while they wrote of happy endings, she often wondered if such tales could truly exist. Her doubts reshape the fables into grim reflections of human nature, where kindness is tested, love hides betrayal, and beauty conceals horror. Each retelling exposes a darker truth behind the illusions of “happily ever after.” As Charlotte listens, familiar fairy tales like Cinderella and Hansel and Gretel are reborn into twisted versions filled with tragedy, fear, and moral conflict. Within these haunting narratives, characters must face desires and consequences more terrifying than monsters themselves. Through Charlotte’s eyes, the Grimm stories transform into cautionary tales that question hope, innocence, and the fragile line between fantasy and reality.",

But the power quickly proves to be a liability when he realizes the potential danger in his skills. Choosing to suppress his power, Mob's only present use for his ability is to impress his longtime crush, Tsubomi, who soon grows bored of the same tricks.\n\nIn order to effectuate control on his skills, Mob enlists himself under the wing of Arataka Reigen, a con artist claiming to be a psychic, who exploits Mob's powers for pocket change. Now, exorcising evil spirits on command has become a part of Mob's daily, monotonous life. However, the psychic energy he exerts is barely the tip of the iceberg; if his vast potential and unrestrained emotions run berserk, a cataclysmic event that would render him completely unrecognizable will be triggered. The progression toward Mob's explosion is rising and attempting to stop it is futile.",

    "description": "The name Tarou Sakamoto once instilled fear in every villain. No other professional hitman matched his prowess, and fellow assassins revered him. However, Sakamoto fell in love. In five short years, he married, became a father, put on some weight, and traded his weapons for an apron as he became the owner of a humble convenience store.\n\nAlthough Sakamoto is decidedly retired, he finds his old life of crime hard to shake off. His former partner, Shin Asakura, reappears and resolves to stay with Sakamoto's family under their strict no-kill rule. To make matters worse, a large bounty is placed on Sakamoto's head. Numerous assassins now pursue him—but they are in for a surprise. Sakamoto has not lost his edge, and no matter what tricks his enemies pull, he will fight off every last one to protect his dear family.",

Bred for the sole purpose of piloting these machines, these children know nothing of the outside world and are only able to prove their existence by defending their race.  \n\nHiro, an aspiring FranXX pilot, has lost his motivation and self-confidence after failing an aptitude test. Skipping out on his class' graduation ceremony, Hiro retreats to a forest lake, where he encounters a mysterious girl with two horns growing out of her head.

Zero Two engages the creature in her FranXX, but it is heavily damaged in the skirmish and crashes near Hiro. Finding her partner dead, Zero Two invites Hiro to pilot the mecha with her, and the duo easily defeats the Klaxosaur in the ensuing fight. With a new partner by his side, Hiro has been given a chance at redemption for his past failures, but at what cost?",
