# Anime List Website

A website to showcase all the anime series I’ve watched in a neat and interactive way.

---

## Description

This is my personal **Anime List website**. I wanted a clean and organized place to display all the anime I’ve watched. Each anime entry shows all the important details—genre, studio, story, and links to **IMDB** and **MyAnimeList**.  

The project started as a basic HTML website. Later, I enhanced it with **CSS** and **JavaScript** to make it interactive, visually appealing, and user-friendly.
